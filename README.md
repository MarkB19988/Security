#### 1. Types of Security Risks to Organisations
The are a many security risks that any organisation can face, and not all of them are directly technology related. Described below are a number of both technological and human security risks.

##### Information Leaks
'Information leaks' is a term that refers to the event in which an employee of the company copies private data about other employees ,or more often, data about projects that the company is working on, and releases it to the public. This type of data breach can be very harmful to the company as rival companies can get knowledge on their upcoming projects and prepare an appropriate response to best them. It can also put the employees in danger if their peronal data leaked.

##### Impersonation
'Impersonation' is the act of posing as an employee of the company or as someone such as an engineer or electrician in order to gain access to the company building. Once inside the imposter can potentially gain access to private data that is stored inside the building and then cause an 'information leak' with the data they find.

##### Viruses
Viruses are a constant security risk that any company that has a computer system will face. The intent of the virus may not always be to steal the company's data, it could just be to damage the company's systems and stop them trading. As there are many different types of computer viruses that exist today it is important for a company to keep their virus protection security up to date.

##### Unauthorized External System Access
'Unauthorized external system access' is the process of someone outside of the company accessing the computer systems to either find private information or to damage the computer system iteslf. External access can be achieved by anyone if the organisation does not exersise good security of passwords and other login details. For example, encrypting these stored details cna help minimize the risk of them being used.

#### 4. How Can Implementing a DMZ, Static IP, NAT Improve Security?

##### DMZ
In networking terms, A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is essensially a sub network that can be used to separate a local network from a public one. The DMZ itself has all of the resources needed for it to be accessed from the internet. However the local network itself is unreachable from the internet. This makes the local network far more secure.

A DMZ is an effective security tool because it serparates the local network from the internet. Because of this potential hackers can’t access data stores on the local network through the internet. Any service that can reached by someone outside of the network, such as email, are put into the DMZ, so in the event of a hack, the data cannot be reached. The most common way to do this is by setting up multiple firewalls, one for the internet and the server, and the other for the sever and the local network.

##### Static IP CHANGE!
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique number that is assigned to devices on a network and works the same way as a normal street address; identifying the device on the internet. IP addresses are used also for network devices to communicate with one another. A static IP address is manually configured for a device, unlike a dynamic one that changes with each network.

Static IPs can ensure that high tier security measures to a stationary address, unlike dynamic IP addresses where the network is constantly changing and this can allow for professional level firewalls and other advanced security systems, being a huge step up from dynamic IPs that just offer a good starting point of security.

##### NAT CHANGE!
NAT, or Network Address Translation, is where a network device is given a public address to computer within a private network and is designed to improve security within a network and to cut down on the number of IP addresses that an organization needs.

What NAT does is hide the IP addresses of servers and computers on trusted networks from computers on other external networks. Should an attacker gain access, it would be hard to stage an attack on the computers as the IP addresses would be hidden from view by NAT.

#### 5. Risk Assessment Procedures

risk assesment, if this was to happen how bad would it be.
look at a company risk procedure, discuss why they are important
usually in tables

#### 6. Data Protection Process and Regulations CHANGE!

Reboot Games must ensure that the organization abides by General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act. In the eyes of the law, Reboot Games are labled as 'Data Controllers' and as such any laws and regulations pertaining to data protection must be followed exactly.

The Data Protection Act dictates that Reboot Games must keep any sensitive and personal data secure and only accessable to the person(s) said information belongs to. The Data Protection Act classifies sensitive and personal data as the following.

"in this Act “sensitive personal data” means personal data consisting of information as to—
- (a)the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject,
- (b)his political opinions,
- (c)his religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature,
- (d)whether he is a member of a trade union (within the meaning of the M1Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992),
- (e)his physical or mental health or condition,
- (f)his sexual life,
- (g)the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, or
- (h)any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.

##### Procedures CHANGE!

- All physical data will be kept in a secure place to prevent any unauthorised viewing. This applies to all sorts of data that can be presented physically and stored electronically.

- Written or printed paper/files will be kept within a locked filing cabinet or drawer.

- Employees will be responsible for any data printouts so that there is no unauthorised viewing as well as destroying any printouts that are no longer required.

- With any data stored electronically, there must be strong protection, both physically and electronically to prevent any threats.

- Data must have accessed assigned to specific employees and a strong password that is frequently changed. This applies to all digitally stored data.

- In physical terms, data stored on removable peripherals will need to be locked away in a secure position when unused.

- Data will not be stored directly to any laptops or other mobile devices. It will only be stored on a designated server located in a secure space.

- Data backups will be carried out regularily.
