#### 1. Types of Security Risks to Organisations
The are a many security risks that any organisation can face, and not all of them are directly technology related. Described below are a number of both technological and human security risks.

##### Information Leaks
'Information leaks' is a term that refers to the event in which an employee of the company copies private data about other employees ,or more often, data about projects that the company is working on, and releases it to the public. This type of data breach can be very harmful to the company as rival companies can get knowledge on their upcoming projects and prepare an appropriate response to best them. It can also put the employees in danger if their peronal data leaked.

##### Impersonation
'Impersonation' is the act of posing as an employee of the company or as someone such as an engineer or electrician in order to gain access to the company building. Once inside the imposter can potentially gain access to private data that is stored inside the building and then cause an 'information leak' with the data they find.

##### Viruses
Viruses are a constant security risk that any company that has a computer system will face. The intent of the virus may not always be to steal the company's data, it could just be to damage the company's systems and stop them trading. As there are many different types of computer viruses that exist today it is important for a company to keep their virus protection security up to date.

##### Unauthorized External System Access
'Unauthorized external system access' is the process of someone outside of the company accessing the computer systems to either find private information or to damage the computer system iteslf. External access can be achieved by anyone if the organisation does not exersise good security of passwords and other login details. For example, encrypting these stored details cna help minimize the risk of them being used.

#### 4. How Can Implementing a DMZ, Static IP, NAT Improve Security?

##### DMZ
In networking terms, A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is essensially a sub network that can be used to separate a local network from a public one. The DMZ itself has all of the resources needed for it to be accessed from the internet. However the local network itself is unreachable from the internet. This makes the local network far more secure.

A DMZ is an effective security tool because it serparates the local network from the internet. Because of this potential hackers canâ€™t access data stores on the local network through the internet. Any service that can reached by someone outside of the network, such as email, are put into the DMZ, so in the event of a hack, the data cannot be reached. The most common way to do this is by setting up multiple firewalls, one for the internet and the server, and the other for the sever and the local network.

##### Static IP CHANGE!
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique number that is assigned to devices on a network and works the same way as a normal street address; identifying the device on the internet. IP addresses are used also for network devices to communicate with one another. A static IP address is manually configured for a device, unlike a dynamic one that changes with each network.

Static IPs can ensure that high tier security measures to a stationary address, unlike dynamic IP addresses where the network is constantly changing and this can allow for professional level firewalls and other advanced security systems, being a huge step up from dynamic IPs that just offer a good starting point of security.

##### NAT CHANGE!
NAT, or Network Address Translation, is where a network device is given a public address to computer within a private network and is designed to improve security within a network and to cut down on the number of IP addresses that an organization needs.

What NAT does is hide the IP addresses of servers and computers on trusted networks from computers on other external networks. Should an attacker gain access, it would be hard to stage an attack on the computers as the IP addresses would be hidden from view by NAT.

#### 5. Risk Assessment Procedures

risk assesment, if this was to happen how bad would it be.
look at a company risk procedure, discuss why they are important
usually in tables

#### 6. Data Protection Process and Regulations
Data Protection is an important aspect of every company as it is goverment regulated and strict rules must be followed by any and all organisations.

data protection act
computer misuse act
european data regulations, must be able to opt out of data storage
