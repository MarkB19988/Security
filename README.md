# Reboot Games Security Policy 

#### 1. Types of Security Risks to Organisations
The are a two main types of security risks that any organisation can face, Described below are a number of both Technological and Physical security risks.

#### Physical
Physical risks are risks that directly involve a person or person(s) gaining access to and or causing damage to the building or hardware within Reboot Games. Below are some examples of physical security risks. 

##### Information Leaks
'Information leaks' is a term that refers to the event in which an employee of the company copies private data about other employees ,or more often, data about projects that the company is working on, and releases it to the public. This type of data breach can be very harmful to the company as rival companies can get knowledge on their upcoming projects and prepare an appropriate response to best them. It can also put the employees in danger if their peronal data leaked.

##### Impersonation
'Impersonation' is the act of posing as an employee of the company or as someone such as an engineer or electrician in order to gain access to the company building. Once inside the imposter can potentially gain access to private data that is stored inside the building and then cause an 'information leak' with the data they find.

#### Technological
Technological security risks are risks that do not involve firect human contact or physical interaction and are instead carried out from outside of the company building. Below are some examples of technological risks.

##### Viruses
Viruses are a constant security risk that any company that has a computer system will face. The intent of the virus may not always be to steal the company's data, it could just be to damage the company's systems and stop them trading. As there are many different types of computer viruses that exist today it is important for a company to keep their virus protection security up to date.

##### Unauthorized External System Access
'Unauthorized external system access' is the process of someone outside of the company accessing the computer systems to either find private information or to damage the computer system iteslf. External access can be achieved by anyone if the organisation does not exersise good security of passwords and other login details. For example, encrypting these stored details cna help minimize the risk of them being used.


#### 2. Reboot Game's Organisational Security Procedures 

Reboot Game's security procedures are designed to reduce the chance of a security breach or the ammount of data loss or damage that could dealt in the event of a breach. These procedures are designed to be followed step by step and instructions will be sent to all members of staff on specific actions and requirements that they need to meet. This can extend outside of the building and the computer system and have an effect on where members of staff are allowed to park and even what they are allowed to bring with them to the workplace.

#### Awareness Procedure

##### Step 1 
Any sighting of suspicious activity by either a member of the public or a member of the public must be immediatly reported to either (a) a higher member of staff that will forward the information to security or (b) security directly.

##### Step 2
If the threat is deemed to be severe, severe being defined as (a) A threat to life of any person(s) currently inside the building or (b) a threat of data theft that would put any and all sensitive data in the building at risk, Then all personel will be immediatly prompted to evacuate the building and the police will be called to deal with the situation.

If the threat is deemed to be under severe then proceed to step 3.

##### Step 3
If the threat is not deemed severe then the company security will deal with the offending person(s). All staff are advised not to attempt to stop the offender themselves and wait for security.


#### Entering and Leaving Procedure
All staff members will be issued with ID cards that will be used to enter and exit the building and individual rooms insided the building. All staff must make sure that they wear their ID cards at all times and DO NOT give their ID card to any individual for any reason. 

##### Step 1
All members of staff will have to scan their ID on the reader as they enter the bulding in order for the door to unlock.

##### Step 2
All members of staff will be asked to scan their ID as they enter any room inside the building, there is a reader next to every room. While the room is always unlocked during working hours, you must still scan your card in order to log who has been in what room.

##### Step 3
When leaving the building, all members of staff will be asked to once again scan their ID in order to log who is left inside the building.

#### 3. Configuration of Firewall Policies and Third Party VPNs

##### Firewall

A Firewall is essentially a piece of hardware or software that decides what traffic is allowed in and out of different ports. There are rules that the firewall uses to make the decision on if a packet of data should be allowed through. A firewall can respond in three different ways to a packet of data. It can (a). Allow the data entry into the network, (b). Reject the data and return an error message or (c). Reject the data without sending an error message.

If a firewall is set up incorrectly it can open up a lot of security risks. For example if the firewall was set up not validate any data and just left certain ports open to any data then a virus could get into the network by simply going through any port and hiding itself as a different kind of packet. for example a virus could hide itsef as web traffic and enter through port 80.

##### VPNs

A VPN, also called a Virtual Private Network is a system that redirects web requests from a private network through a different network. The VPN acts as a 'middle man' between the private network and the internet. The VPN will take the request and look for it on the internet, then give the data back to the private network.

if a VPN is set up incorrectly or without due care, then there are some potential security risks. For example when using a thrid party VPN, their servers are ususally public to anyone who signs up to the service. In theory this means that anyone signed up to that specific service can see all of the web requests from all of the different users that use that server as their VPN

#### 4. How Can Implementing a DMZ, Static IP, NAT Improve Security?

##### DMZ
In networking terms, A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is essensially a sub network that can be used to separate a local network from a public one. The DMZ itself has all of the resources needed for it to be accessed from the internet. However the local network itself is unreachable from the internet. This makes the local network far more secure.

A DMZ is an effective security tool because it serparates the local network from the internet. Because of this potential hackers can’t access data stores on the local network through the internet. Any service that can reached by someone outside of the network, such as email, are put into the DMZ, so in the event of a hack, the data cannot be reached. The most common way to do this is by setting up multiple firewalls, one for the internet and the server, and the other for the sever and the local network.

##### Static IP
IP address stands for Internet Protocol address, is a unique number that is assigned to devices on a network that is used to identify that specific device iver the internet. Any device that is connected to the internet is assigend an IP address. A static IP address is one that is manually assigned and does not change while a dynamic IP is one that changes every time that device re-connects to the internet.

The use of Static IP's allows for the network to implement more features and perform more tasks, such as hosting a website or an FTP server as these require a static IP in order to function. 

##### NAT
NAT, or Network Address Translation, refers to the process in which a device is given a public address to computer within a private network. It is designed to cut down on the ammount of IP addresses a company uses and can be used to improve security. This is because NAT hides the IP addresses of servers and computers on the internal network from computers on external networks or over the internet. In the event of a breach, It would be much more difficult to cause any damage or access more of the network as IP addresses would be hidden.

#### 6. Data Protection Process and Regulations

Reboot Games must ensure that the organization abides by General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act. In the eyes of the law, Reboot Games are labled as 'Data Controllers' and as such any laws and regulations pertaining to data protection must be followed exactly.

The Data Protection Act dictates that Reboot Games must keep any sensitive and personal data secure and only accessable to the person(s) said information belongs to. The Data Protection Act classifies sensitive and personal data as the following.

- (g) the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence, or
- (h) any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.

Anyone wanting to access personal or sensitive data will need to either (a). Provide 2 forms of photo identification to a member of staff to confirm their identitiy. or (b). if wanting access via telephone, have the member of staff on the phone confirm 2 different entries of data such as date of birth and a security question(s) set up by the user.

##### Procedures 

- All physical data will be kept secure and seperate from the main site. Access will be restricted to authorized personel only.

- Any paperwork will be stored inside a locked container at all times.

- Employees will be instructed to destroy any paperwork or files that are no longer relevent or needed.

- Data backups will be performed on a regular basis

- Any computers storing sensitive data must have said data encrypted and regularly updated anti-virus software installed.

- All employees must change their passwords every 2 months.

- Any portable drives containing sensitive data must also be locked away with the paperwork.


#### 8. Main Components of the Organisational Disaster Recovery Plan 

A Disaster Recovery Plan is a plan that is put in place to be followed in the event of a catastrophy to ensure that the company is able to recover as quickly as possible. A disater is any event that would cause Reboot Games to cease trading if this event were to occur. 

Some examples of disasters are:

##### Fire
If a fire was to spread throughout the building then not only would Reboot Games lose access its workplace but it could also cause significant data loss if the correct back up procedures were not in place.

##### Sabotage
Sabotage is the act of someone within the company doing something that would cause Reboot Games to stop trading. This could range from drestroying hardware, data or causing damage to the building or harm to personel.

The main components of a disaster recovery plan are as follows:

##### Recovery Process

The recovery process outlines what needs protecting and what is critical during a disaster recovery. Anything defined here is essential for the company to continue to operate, so maximum effort must go into either preserving or backing up these important systems. Anything that is not defined here will ususally be take care of after the essential parts are full functional again. This component is important to include in a disaster recovery plan because it enables the company to come back online after a disaster as quickly as possible by focussing efforts on the most key and important systems.

##### Responsibilities

Everyones responsibilities should be made immediately clear in a disaster recovery plan. Tasks and responsibilities are given to members of the organisation to work on so all issues can be addressed at the same time. The process of getting different people to work on different key parts means there is less for any one individual to do during the disaster recovery process. This part is important because it speeds up the process of recovery by dividing up the workload.

##### Timeframe

Timeframe refers to how much time individual tasks during the recovery process are estimated to take. As stated before the recovery responsibilities are divided up between the workforce, each of these responsibilities and tasks are given a timeframe. If the timeframe is followed then the company can get back to working order at or before the estimated time. A timeframe is important to implement so that there is an estimation of when the company will be back up and working again, this can be relayed to clients and provide them with some knowledge of what is happening and when the company will be back up and running.
